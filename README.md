SENTINEL Anti-Cheat Detection Engine

A proprietary, supplemental cheat detection SDK designed to address documented gaps in Activision's RICOCHET Anti-Cheat system for Call of Duty.

What It Does

SENTINEL provides five real-time detection modules that target cheat vectors RICOCHET currently misses:

Aim Analysis — snap angles, tracking smoothness, headshot rate anomalies
Input Analysis — Cronus Zen / hardware cheat detection via entropy and timing patterns
Packet Analysis — injection detection, replay attacks, data flooding
Statistical Analysis — impossible K/D ratios, accuracy z-scores, win rate anomalies
Behavioral Analysis — wallhack/ESP detection, pre-firing, spawn prediction

Architecture

Eight standalone TypeScript files. Zero external dependencies. Drop-in ready for any Node.js server environment.
